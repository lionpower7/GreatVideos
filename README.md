Breaking Down The Files: 

Our Box-Model Designs(Like Border, Border-Radius ,Padding, BG, Display & etc...) will go in our main css file (Great.css). Styling Of Text will go on Great_T.css, So we will import that file to Great.css (Like so, @import Great_T.css;). Flex-Box Design will be imported to Great.css (Like so, @import Great_S.css;). Responsive Design Through Media Queries will be made in Great-Res.css, This will also be imported to Great.css (Like so, @import Great-Res.css;). 

Javascript files will be organized as the Project Progresses.
